/**
 * @interface strange.extensions.mediation.impl.MediationBinding
 * 
 * Subclass of Binding for MediationBinding.
 * 
 * MediationBindings support the following extensions of standard Bindings:
 *
 * ToMediator - Porcelain for To<T> providing a little extra clarity and security.
 *
 * ToAbstraction<T> - Provide an Interface or base Class adapter for the View.
 * When the binding specifies ToAbstraction<T>, the Mediator will be expected to inject <T>
 * instead of the concrete View class.
